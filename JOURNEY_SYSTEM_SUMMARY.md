## 📋 **REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES**

### **Crisis Response Example:**
**User**: "Just got diagnosed with HIV, I'm terrified"  
**IVOR Response**: 
```
💜 I hear you, and I want you to know that you're not alone. Your safety and wellbeing matter deeply.

🚨 Immediate Support Available:
• Terrence Higgins Trust: 📞 0808 802 1221
  Leading HIV and sexual health charity with specialist support
• menrus.co.uk: 🌐 https://menrus.co.uk
  Comprehensive sexual health platform for Black queer men

📋 Specific Information:
HIV treatment in the UK is free through the NHS and highly effective. Modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) can make HIV undetectable and untransmittable (U=U)...

🌱 Next: Stabilization - Building ongoing safety, regular support systems, and beginning to process what happened at your own pace. You don't have to do this alone.
```

### **Growth Stage Example:**
**User**: "I want to learn about PrEP on the NHS"  
**IVOR Response**: 
```
✨ Love seeing you focused on growth and development! This is where things get exciting.

📈 Here's what you need to know:
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) prevents HIV infection and is available free on the NHS in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

NHS PrEP:
• Free prescription through GUM clinics
• Regular monitoring required (every 3 months)
• Available to anyone at high risk of HIV
• No restrictions based on sexuality or identity

🫂 Next: Community Healing - Connecting your personal growth with community healing spaces, sharing your journey, and supporting others in theirs.
```
